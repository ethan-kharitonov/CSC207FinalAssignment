# group_0241 ~ maze-game

## Requirements
You need JDK 17 to run this program, because libraries used in this project are not compatible with JDK 18.

This project is built using gradle and the GDX game library.
## Game Instructions (Phase1)
To execute this program, you have to run the console.Main class (Have the console open as large as you can to not miss any text).

Then, enter 3 to run a demo of the game.

Move around with the WASD keys and click on the screen with the mouse cursor to shoot.

Alternatively, you may explore the login system.

## Login System (Phase0)

Instead of running  the game, enter 2 followed by the return key in the console to sign up. Your username cannot be the same as someone else's.

To log in, enter 1 followed by your username and password.

After login, you are able to access login history, add user, and exit by following the command table. An admin may also delete, ban, and unban other non-admin accounts. To have an admin account, you must be added by another admin.

IMPORTANT: Terminating the program through console (instead of selecting the exit option) will prevent any new data from being saved.

There is a built-in admin user:

Username: admin *(previously: TestAdmin)*

Password: 123
